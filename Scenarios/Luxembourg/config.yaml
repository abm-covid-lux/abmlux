# The distances referred to above are distances along a real world transportation network. This
# typically differs from the spherical distance. Over short distances, the spherical distance is
# approximately equal to the Euclidean distance. The ratio of the network distance and the Euclidean
# distance is called the 'network detour ratio'. The network distance is often around 1.25–1.41
# times the Euclidean distance. The article
#
# Hai Yanga, Jintao Kea and Jieping Ye, 'A universal distribution law of network detour ratios',
# Transportation Research Part C, 2018.
#
# suggests that network distance follows a distribution of the form
#
# network_distance = euclidean_distance*alpha + beta
#
# for two parameters alpha and beta, which the authors determine as follows:
alpha: 1.2988
beta:  0.3838
