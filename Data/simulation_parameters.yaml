# These labels will also be mapped onto activities in the time of

# ################################# Activities ########################
# The Time-of-use survey data has a list of primary activities
# and secondary activities.  Here we map them onto our own list
# of activities
#
# NOTE: the keys in this list are NOT locations and do not have to match
#       the list in location_counts above
#
# Each key points at a list of activity codes from the TUS.  We map
# these in reverse back onto the key when loading TUS data, e.g.
# House: [1,5] would map codes 1 and 5 from the TUS data onto the 'House'
# activity in this simulation.
